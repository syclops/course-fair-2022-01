# Larger-scale Software Development

## Description

In this course, you'll learn about developing, deploying, and maintaining larger software through the lens of building useful software or services for the Olin community. In doing this, we'll get to look at more advanced workflows in version control, how to set up and configure virtual machines both locally and in the cloud, how to monitor services, and how to work on teams to do things like code reviews and postmortem analysis. You'll get to practice your skills through both smaller exercises and by contributing to larger projects over the semester.

## Learning Goals

1. Practice fundamental software development skills like teamwork, communication, testing, and code reviews.
2. Learn principles of software development through tools such as Git, Ansible, Docker, and Terraform.
3. Design, test, and build larger software systems that run in the cloud.

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Understand the degree to which a deployed system can scale over time or number of users.
* Conduct a code review with a team.
* Monitor a running service and diagnose/recover from failures.
* Provision and configure a remote machine.

## Prerequisites

ENGR 2510 (Software Design) is required.

ENGR 3515 (Data Structures and Algorithms) is helpful, but not required.
