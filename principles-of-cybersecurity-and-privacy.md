# Principles of Cybersecurity and Privacy

## Description

In this course, we will study foundational principles of cybersecurity and privacy through the lens of a semester long case study: using your phone to take and send a picture to a friend. In doing this, we'll get to study topics from cryptography, software security, network security, and privacy. We'll use real-world exercises aimed at doing things like fooling smartphone unlocking, cheating at video games, writing a data privacy law, and building better security systems for airports. At the end of the semester, you'll get to do a project to more deeply explore an area.

## Learning Goals

1. **Develop your security mindset.** Identify assumptions about a system and the ways in which the system's behavior relies on those assumptions.
2. **Practice cybersecurity and privacy concepts through hands-on experience.** Analyze, attack, defend, or fix systems like what you might find in the real world.
3. **Understand the societal culture and context of cybersecurity and privacy.** Describe the practices and norms of cybersecurity professionals, and debate the use of cybersecurity and privacy measures in society.

At the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Identify how and why a system can be made to behave in undesired ways.
* Describe the steps, and write software, to carry out various attacks on the systems we examine in the course.
* Explain the relevant terminology, norms, and practices of cybersecurity and privacy, as well as the intersection of these fields with public policy, ethics, and society.
